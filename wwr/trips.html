                    <img src="images/figure-img5.jpg" alt="The Big One">
                    <p>The Big One is a multi-day rafting trip in Northern Utah. The river is filled with water rapids and a few drops. Participants will stop at one of two campsites where they will spend the night before continuing through the rest of the river.</p>

                    <img src="images/figure-img2.jpg" alt="Water Rapid Way">
                    <p>Water Rapid Way is the shortest of the five trips White Water Rafting plans every year, however it's the most intense one. Located in South-Eastern Idaho, It is filled with intense river rapids and a few small drops. There are a campsite about half way through the river in case one of the participants need to stop.</p>

                    <h4>The Journey</h4>
                    <img src="images/figure-img3.jpg" alt="The Journey">
                    <p>The Journey is the longest of the five trips White Water Rafting plans and the most physically demanding. The participants will have to work together to paddle through intense river rapids through the hot Arizona sun. Participants will stop at 5 of the 10 campsites where they will get some rest before having to continue through The Journey.</p>

                    <h4>Road to Heaven</h4>
                    <img src="images/figure-img1.jpg" alt="Road to Heaven">
                    <p>The Road to Heaven provides a solid balance of intensity, and scenery. Participants will work together to get through many river rapids and drops, while getting to look around at the Southern Utah landscape. Participants will stop about 250 miles in before having to deflate the rafts and walk up a 5 mile trail to the 1st campsite, where they will spend the night before continuing rafting at a different part of the river. Then, they will either stop at another campsite near the end of the day or reach the end of the trip.</p>

                    <img src="images/figureimg4.jpg" alt="Nature's Road">
                    <p>Nature's Road is the most scenic trip that White Water Rafting goes on. Aside from a couple of drops and river rafting, Participants will mostly be able to see the beautiful Florida landscape. Although, there is a campsite partway through the river, Participants will rarely stop for the night.</p>
