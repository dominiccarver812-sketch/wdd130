        <p>Hello, my name is Dominic Carver. I am 19 years old. My favorite hobbies are video games, and activities with
            my family whether they
            are indoor or outdoor activities. I am currently a student at BYU Pathway and I am studying Web & Computer
            Programming. I would love to
            become a video game designer and program my own video game.</p>
